    <h2>Who I Am</h2>
    <div class="founder">
      <img src="images/founder.jpg" alt="Founder Photo">
      <div>
        <p>I am a healthcare management professional with nearly two decades of experience managing and scaling healthcare businesses, including organizations with up to $1 billion in revenue.</p>
        <p>I come from a family of entrepreneurs, where the importance of hard work, integrity, and taking care of people was instilled early on. I earned my MBA from the University of Chicago Booth School of Business, where my entrepreneurial journey began to take shape.</p>
        <p>In 2023, after welcoming my daughter, the desire to build something lasting — and to steward a business with care for the long term — became clear. That motivation led to the creation of Street 77 Partners.</p>
        <p>My goal is to acquire a business I can operate for the rest of my professional life, preserving what makes it special while supporting its next chapter of growth.</p>
